# Shopping Cart App

![Image of App](https://github.com/ricardomokhtari/Shopping_Cart_App/blob/master/Images/App.png)


A basic shopping cart app UI that I created using React following Mosh Hamedani's React crash course, with some (mostly aesthetic) modifications.

To run this app type the following in terminal:

```
create-react-app shopping-cart-app
cd shopping-cart-app
npm start
```

Then replace the default 'src' folder with the 'src' folder in this repository

Note: this app also uses bootstrap, which can be installed directly in VS code or in terminal using:

```
npm i bootstrap@4.1.1
```
