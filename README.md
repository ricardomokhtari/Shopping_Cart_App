# Shopping_Cart_App
A basic shopping cart app UI that I created using React following Mosh Hamedani's React crash course, with some modifications.

Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0

To run this app type the following in terminal:

```
create-react-app app_name
cd app_name
npm start
```

Then replace the default 'src' folder with the 'src' folder in this repository

Note: this app also uses bootstrap, which can be installed directly in VS code or in terminal using:

```
npm i bootstrap@4.1.1
```
